# Nature-Inspired Optimization Framework

This project is a framework developed to visualize and evaluate nature-inspired optimization algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems, particularly the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). It focuses on implementing and comparing various algorithms like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Evolutionary Algorithms ((1+1) EA, (µ+λ) EA).

## Project Overview
The framework provides a modular platform to experiment with different algorithms by adjusting parameters and visualizing their behavior on specific problems. It is designed to be adaptable, enabling users to add new algorithms and optimization challenges easily.

### Key Features
- **Visualization:** Supports real-time visualization of the optimization process, showcasing the solution construction of each algorithm.
- **Framework Design:** Built using JavaFX, with a modular approach following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Includes implementations of ACO, SA, and different variants of Evolutionary Algorithms.
- **Benchmark Testing:** Allows benchmarking under different parameter settings to analyze algorithm performance.
